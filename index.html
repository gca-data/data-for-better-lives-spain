      <h2>1. How Data Is Transforming Development in Spain</h2>
      <p>
        Spain is undergoing a profound digital transformation driven by mobility data, health information
        systems, financial platforms, and satellite imagery. Data already contributes to better
        decision-making in several key sectors:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <div class="point-title">✔ Mobility and transport efficiency (Madrid, Barcelona)</div>
          <div class="point-text">
            Real-time mobility data from buses, metros, and navigation apps helps optimize transport flows
            and manage congestion.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="point-title">✔ Climate and wildfire management</div>
          <div class="point-text">
            Earth observation data is used by the Generalitat and national agencies to predict fire risk,
            water scarcity, and other climate-related threats.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="point-title">✔ Health system modernization (SNS & autonomous regions)</div>
          <div class="point-text">
            The digitalization of medical records improves coordination across levels of care, especially
            in remote and aging regions.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="point-title">✔ Tourism and economic planning</div>
          <div class="point-text">
            Private intent data from hotels, booking platforms, and telecoms helps understand seasonal
            dynamics and local economic activity.
          </div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Spain already has the data. The next step is ensuring that public sector leadership has the literacy,
        confidence, and institutional support needed to turn these data assets into better policies.

      <h2>2. The Challenge: Spain Still Lacks a Strong, Coherent Data Culture</h2>
      <p>Despite progress, several barriers still limit Spain’s ability to fully leverage its data ecosystem:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <div class="point-title">• Fragmentation across autonomous communities</div>
          <div class="point-text">
            Health, transport, and education data often remain siloed due to governance and interoperability
            gaps between regions and institutions.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="point-title">• Uneven levels of data literacy among senior officials</div>
          <div class="point-text">
            Many leaders continue to rely on traditional reports rather than real-time analytics
            or structured partnerships with private data holders.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="point-title">• Limited reuse of private intent data</div>
          <div class="point-text">
            Telecom mobility data, platform transaction data, and digital payments remain underutilized
            for policy design and evaluation.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="point-title">• Insufficient public understanding and trust</div>
          <div class="point-text">
            Citizens express concerns about privacy, algorithmic bias, and how government institutions
            use their data.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="point-title">• Lack of a central institution to coordinate data governance</div>
          <div class="point-text">
            Multiple ministries and agencies have overlapping responsibilities without a unified framework
            or clear leadership on data governance.
          </div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Spain has enormous potential, but it needs a clear, coordinated national strategy for building a culture
        of data across its public institutions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 3 -->
    <section>
      <h2>3. Proposed Solution: Create a National Data Leadership Program for Spain</h2>
      <p>
        The National Data Leadership Program (NDLP) would build Spain’s capacity to use data ethically,
        effectively, and strategically across all levels of government.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <div class="point-title">1️⃣ High-Level Training for Senior Leadership</div>
          <div class="point-text">
            Equip ministers, secretaries-general, and regional leaders with skills to:
            <ul>
              <li>Understand modern data sources (public and private intent data).</li>
              <li>Interpret analytics for decision-making.</li>
              <li>Encourage responsible experimentation and innovation.</li>
              <li>Ensure privacy and ethical use of data in line with GDPR.</li>
            </ul>
            This program would be practical, case-based, and aligned with the Spanish public administration context.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="point-title">2️⃣ A Unified National Data Governance Framework</div>
          <div class="point-text">
            Spain needs a coherent, nationwide data governance strategy that includes:
            <ul>
              <li>Interoperability standards across autonomous communities.</li>
              <li>Clear legal frameworks for responsible public–private data sharing.</li>
              <li>Privacy-by-design principles consistent with GDPR.</li>
              <li>Unified oversight under a dedicated National Data Authority.</li>
            </ul>
            This framework will build consistency, trust, and data portability across the country.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="point-title">3️⃣ Partnerships With Universities, Startups, and Large Data Holders</div>
          <div class="point-text">
            Spain has world-class institutions (CSIC, universities, Telefónica, BBVA, Santander) that already
            analyze large datasets. The government can:
            <ul>
              <li>Collaborate on mobility, financial inclusion, and climate models.</li>
              <li>Negotiate privacy-safe access to anonymized mobility and platform data.</li>
              <li>Support evidence-based regional development policies.</li>
            </ul>
            This ensures data-driven innovation benefits all regions, not just Madrid and Barcelona.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="point-title">4️⃣ National Open-Data Platform 2.0</div>
          <div class="point-text">
            Spain’s open-data portals are strong but can be modernized to:
            <ul>
              <li>Include more real-time datasets.</li>
              <li>Add visual dashboards for citizens and decision-makers.</li>
              <li>Integrate regional and municipal datasets.</li>
              <li>Allow secure researcher access through APIs.</li>
            </ul>
            This will reinforce transparency, reuse, and public trust.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="point-title">5️⃣ Applied “Learning by Doing” Pilots</div>
          <div class="point-text">
            Pilot projects can be deployed in:
            <ul>
              <li>Wildfire prediction and climate risk.</li>
              <li>Hospital emergency optimization.</li>
              <li>Poverty mapping in rural areas.</li>
              <li>Coastal erosion and climate planning.</li>
              <li>Public transport redesign in smaller cities.</li>
            </ul>
            These concrete applications will help institutions internalize the value of data and build lasting capacity.
