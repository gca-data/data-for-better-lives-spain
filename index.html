    <h1>Data for Better Lives in Spain</h1>
    <p>A Proposal to Build a National Culture of Data</p>
  </header>

    <!-- Section 1 -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>1. How Data Is Transforming Development in Spain</h2>
      <p>
        Spain is undergoing a profound digital transformation driven by mobility
        data, health information systems, financial platforms, and satellite
        imagery. Data already contributes to better decision-making in areas
        such as:
      </p>

      <h3><span class="check">✔</span> Mobility and transport efficiency (Madrid, Barcelona)</h3>
      <p>
			Real-time mobility data from buses, metros, and navigation apps
			optimizes transport flows.
      </p>

      <h3><span class="check">✔</span> Climate and wildfire management</h3>
      <p>
			Earth observation data is used by the Generalitat and national agencies
			to predict fire risk and water scarcity.
      </p>

      <h3><span class="check">✔</span> Health system modernization (SNS &amp; autonomous regions)</h3>
      <p>
			The digitalization of medical records improves service coordination,
			especially in remote and aging regions.
      </p>

      <h3><span class="check">✔</span> Tourism and economic planning</h3>
      <p>
			Private intent data from hotels, booking platforms, and telecoms helps
			understand seasonal dynamics and local economic activity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Spain has the data. The next step is ensuring the public sector
        leadership has the literacy, confidence, and institutional support
        needed to turn these data assets into better policies.
      </p>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>2. The Challenge: Spain Still Lacks a Strong, Coherent Data Culture</h2>
      <p>
        Despite progress, several barriers still limit the country’s ability to
        fully leverage its data ecosystem:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Fragmentation across autonomous communities</strong><br />
          Health, transport, and education data often remain siloed due to
          governance and interoperability gaps.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Uneven levels of data literacy among senior officials</strong
          ><br />
          Many leaders rely on traditional reports rather than real-time
          analytics or private data partnerships.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Limited reuse of private intent data</strong><br />
          Telecom mobility, platform transaction data, or digital payments
          remain underutilized for policy design.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Insufficient public understanding and trust</strong><br />
          Citizens express concerns about privacy, algorithmic bias, and the use
          of their data by government institutions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Lack of a central institution to coordinate data
            governance</strong
          ><br />
          Multiple ministries have overlapping responsibilities without a
          unified framework.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Spain has enormous potential — but needs a clear, coordinated national
        strategy for building a culture of data across its public institutions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>3. Proposed Solution: Create a National Data Leadership Program for Spain</h2>
      <p>
        The National Data Leadership Program (NDLP) would build Spain’s capacity
        to use data ethically, effectively, and strategically across all levels
        of government.
      </p>

      <h3>1️⃣ High-Level Training for Senior Leadership</h3>
      <p>Equip ministers, secretaries-general, and regional leadership with skills to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>understand modern data sources (public + private intent data);</li>
        <li>interpret analytics for decisions;</li>
        <li>encourage responsible experimentation; and</li>
        <li>ensure privacy and ethical use.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This program would be practical, case-based, and aligned with the
        Spanish public administration context.
      </p>

      <h3>2️⃣ A Unified National Data Governance Framework</h3>
      <p>
        Spain needs a coherent, nationwide data governance strategy that
        includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>interoperability standards across autonomous communities;</li>
        <li>
          clear legal frameworks for responsible public–private data sharing;
        </li>
        <li>privacy-by-design principles consistent with GDPR; and</li>
        <li>
          unified oversight under a dedicated National Data Authority.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This builds consistency, trust, and data portability across the country.
      </p>

      <h3>3️⃣ Partnerships With Universities, Startups, and Large Data Holders</h3>
      <p>
        Spain has world-class institutions (CSIC, universities, Telefónica,
        BBVA, Santander) that already analyze massive datasets.
      </p>
      <p>The government can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>collaborate on mobility, financial inclusion, and climate models;</li>
        <li>
          negotiate privacy-safe access to anonymized mobility and platform
          data; and
        </li>
        <li>support evidence-based regional development policies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This ensures data-driven innovation benefits all regions, not just
        Madrid and Barcelona.
      </p>

      <h3>4️⃣ National Open-Data Platform 2.0</h3>
      <p>
        Spain’s open-data portals are strong but can be modernized to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>include more real-time datasets;</li>
        <li>add visual dashboards for citizens;</li>
        <li>integrate regional and municipal datasets; and</li>
        <li>allow secure researcher access through APIs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This reinforces transparency and public trust.</p>

      <h3>5️⃣ Applied “Learning by Doing” Pilots</h3>
      <p>Pilot projects in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>wildfire prediction;</li>
        <li>hospital emergency optimization;</li>
        <li>poverty mapping in rural areas;</li>
        <li>coastal erosion and climate planning; and</li>
        <li>public transport redesign in smaller cities.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These concrete applications help institutions internalize the value of
        data.
